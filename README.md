#### Abstract: Briefly describe your problem, approach, and key results. Should be no more than 300 words.
    
#### Introduction (10%): Describe the problem you are working on, why itâ€™s important, and an overview of your results
    
####  Related Work (10%): Discuss published work that relates to your project. How is your approach similar or different from others?
    
####  Data (10%): Describe the data you are working with for your project. What type of data is it? Where did it come from? How much data are you working with? Did you have to do any preprocessing, filtering, or other special treatment to use this data in your project?
    
#### Methods (30%): Discuss your approach for solving the problems that you set up in the introduction. Why is your approach the right thing to do? Did you consider alternative approaches? You should demonstrate that you have applied ideas and skills built up during the quarter to tackling your problem of choice. It may be helpful to include figures, diagrams, or tables to describe your method or compare it with other methods.
    
####  Experiments (30%): Discuss the experiments that you performed to demonstrate that your approach solves the problem. The exact experiments will vary depending on the project, but you might compare with previously published methods, perform an ablation study to determine the impact of various components of your system, experiment with different hyperparameters or architectural choices, use visualization techniques to gain insight into how your model works, discuss common failure modes of your model, etc. You should include graphs, tables, or other figures to illustrate your experimental results.
    
#### Conclusion (5%) Summarize your key results - what have you learned? Suggest ideas for future extensions or new applications of your ideas.
